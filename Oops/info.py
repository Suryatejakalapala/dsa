#Object Oriented Programming 

#Everything is Object in Python (pure oops language)

def hello(): # the hello function is the object of the Fucntion class
    print('hello')


x = 1

print(type(x)) # x is a object of the int class
print(type('hi')) # same as hi is a object of the str class
print(type(hello))
print(type(type))

print(isinstance('hi' , object))
